##  1. Apache Shiro

Shiro targets what the Shiro development team calls “the four cornerstones of application security” - Authentication, Authorization, Session Management, and Cryptography:

- Authentication: Sometimes referred to as ‘login’, this is the act of proving a user is who they say they are.
- 
- Authorization: The process of access control, i.e. determining ‘who’ has access to ‘what’.
- 
- Session Management: Managing user-specific sessions, even in non-web or EJB applications.
- 
- Cryptography: Keeping data secure using cryptographic algorithms while still being easy to use

There are also additional features to support and reinforce these concerns in different application environments, especially:

- Web Support: Shiro’s web support APIs help easily secure web applications.
- Caching: Caching is a first-tier citizen in Apache Shiro’s API to ensure that security operations remain fast and efficient.
- Concurrency: Apache Shiro supports multi-threaded applications with its concurrency features.
- Testing: Test support exists to help you write unit and integration tests and ensure your code will be secured as expected.
- “Run As”: A feature that allows users to assume the identity of another user (if they are allowed), sometimes useful in administrative scenarios.
- “Remember Me”: Remember users’ identities across sessions so they only need to log in when mandatory.
